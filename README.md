# Energy-Consumption-Data-analysis
The goal of this project is to analyse an energy consumption dataset from the specific region over six month period, identify trends and patterns , provide actionable insights , and train basic regression models to predict energy consumption.

Dataset Description: The dataset contains information about the energy consumption of an HVAC system, recorded over six months, with the following columns:

Time: Timestamp of the energy consumption reading. AHU HOURS (D60): Number of hours the system was running. CHW VALVE ANALOG OUTPUT1 (D67): Percentage of the valve that was on. Current (D68): Electric current being consumed by the HVAC system at the time of the reading. Power (D69): Electric power being consumed by the HVAC system. Consumption (D77): Total energy consumption up to that timestamp. Consumption_difference: Difference in total energy consumption between consecutive timestamps. RETURN AIR TEMP (D63): Return air temperature of the HVAC. SUPPLY AIR TEMP (D65): Supply air temperature of the HVAC. VFD Frequency (D71): Variable frequency drives run frequency. VFD Speed (D70): Variable frequency drives run speed.
